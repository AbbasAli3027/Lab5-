#My Music Website

#Project Overview
This project was created to showcase my favourite sounds in terms of artists,genres and instruments!

#Design Process
When designing this website i wanted to keep it clean and simple but also make it visually appealing
thats why i went with a simple colour scheme as well as interactive hover features, audio playing options
and visually appealing animations as well as pictures to go with each card since a picture is worth a 1000 words

#Devlopment Proccess
i opted to keep this application simple, no javascript just css and html. i decided to test my abilities
in terms of making cool animations with just css since javascript does make it much easier to create animations
and i wanted to challenge my css skills.
